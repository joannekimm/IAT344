            	 <p> In the Spring 2023 semester, I had the opportunity to create a poetry video for IAT 334 and collaborate with the Poet Laureate of Vancouver Fiona Tinwei Lam for a Video Poetry Competition. We chose the award winning poem "This was meant to be for Nora" to create a compelling digital story about the establishment of the Vancouver Black Community through the gaze of a little girl and her dream about the Black community legends Jimi and Nora Hendrix. </p>

              <h2> Project overview </h2>

              <p> For our final short video project, we decided to choose the poem “This was meant to be for Nora” by Nora Hendrix, a Vancouver Black Community Legend who contributed to the establishment of the black community and important monuments such as the Hogan’s Alley and co-founded the city’s only Black church, Fountain Chapel. Our primary goal of this project was to illustrate how the community was established in the eyes of a little girl who tries to reminisce the contribution of her grandmother as physical artifacts of these landmarks no longer remain in reality. </p>

            <h2>My role within the team</h2>

            <p> My role within the team was director and set designer. Although everybody on the team contributed to the ideation of the short film and storyboarding, I helped direct the conceptualizations into reality. I thought of specific locations we can shoot the scenes and helped source props we could use to reflect the poem better in our film. One of the most important props I sourced was the yarn used for knitting the scarf which  took over 3 hours to complete.</p>

            </figure>


             <p>During the actual filming of our introductory scene, I helped direct Yenan who was the cameraman by testing out different lighting, camera angles and motion. This was to perfectly capture the essence of the poem in the first few scenes of the short film. </p>

             <h2> Ideation </h2>
             <p> Our team initially struggled to grasp the main idea of the poem and unpack the poem in a respectful manner as students who aren’t ethnically Black. We had many brainstorming sessions to come up with the key ideas we wanted to convey through this poem and Hanako came up with the yarn / knitting idea to serve as a metaphor to depict the establishment of the black community. We attended multiple office hours to get feedback on our updated storyboards and after multiple refinements, we got the OK to move forward with the shooting. </p>

             <h3> Symbolism </h3>

             <p> These are the 4 symbols we ideated as a team to draw meaningful connections to the poem in a metaphorical way.</p>

             <ul>
                <li> Knitting:  We utilize knitting to represent Nora’s efforts and contributions to the black community and use threads of yarn as a gateway to connect the dream and the reality </li>
                <li> Tree: The tree that blossoms in our animation is symbolic of the stanza in the poem which talks about passing down Nora’s legacy from one generation to another </li>
                <li> Community: The community and important landmarks such as Hogan’s alley is first depicted without colour in black and white. Through the influence of the guitar legend Jimi Hendrix and his famous pieces like purple haze, the city regains colour and liveliness. </li>
                <li> Yarn bombing: Hogan’s alley is a landmark that no longer exists. The current area is covered with colourful murals to commemorate the alley and what it represents for the black community, so we want to represent this in our animation.</li>
              </ul>

             <h2 class ="small">Rough draft </h2>

             <p>For the rough draft, we filmed the first two scenes of the short film at my house. It was really important for the first scene to really set the mood and tone for the rest of the short film and introduce the influence of Jimi Hendrix’s music and the yarn. It took us a couple hours to film just the first few seconds because we played a lot with the lighting and tested out different placements and camera motions to get the best shot possible. </p>

            <h3>Directing the stop motion video</h3>

             <p> Another metaphor we wanted to use in our short film was a tree. We wanted to utilize a tree to show how Nora Hendrix’s legacy is being passed down from generation to another through stop motion footage of a yarn blossoming into a tree. Yenan and I booked a green room at SFU and got creative with how we wanted to show this process with beads and yarn. </p>

           </figure>

            <h3 class ="small"> Critique & application of feedback</h3>
            <p> Our team received a lot of valuable feedback from the teaching team after our rough cut presentation. </p>

            <figure>
              <img src = "img/team.jpeg" alt= "team" width = "800">

            </figure>

            <h3 class ="small"> Key takeaways </h3>
            <p>Some of the feedback included contextualizing the poem more such as showing where the poem takes place and who this poem is about. In order to improve this aspect of our film, my teammates went back to Hogan’s Alley and took more footage of important details like plaques. I also added some photos of Jimi Hendrix and put them in picture frames in the background of the first scene to help contextualize Jimi’s music playing on the radio. </p>

            </figure>

            <p> We were also told to emphasize Jimi’s presence a bit more, so we decided to use neon purple lights when filming and include chords of Jimi Hendrix’s famous piece “purple haze” in the audio production. </p>

          <h2> Shooting the final cut </h2>
          <p> The second time around, we made adjustments to the storyboard to contextualize the poem better and we had a more clear direction on how we wanted to execute this short film.</p>

            <p> We had 3 different shooting days; one at my house for the first few scenes, another at Hogan’s Alley and the last one in the green room at SFU to film the stop motion of knitting. </p>

               <h2>Reflection</h2>

               <p>I was initially very worried about this project, because I had a hard time interpreting the poem and coming up with ideas that would respectfully represent the poem in such a short film. However, through countless hours of brainstorming and getting valuable feedback from the teaching team, we were able to represent the poem through a series of metaphors which was a huge goal my team had from the start. I am very satisfied with the final edit of our short film and I am thankful for all my group members’ hard work and contributions. If I could do this all over again, one thing I would do is take a lot of time to read through each stanza of the poem and really take the time to understand the history of the Vancouver Black community because without understanding the essence of the poem, it’s impossible to produce a film that reflects it.  </p>
